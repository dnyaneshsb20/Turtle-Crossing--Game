## About the Project

The **Turtle Crossing Game** is a simple and fun Python arcade game where the player helps a turtle cross a busy road filled with fast-moving cars.
The goal is to safely reach the finish line at the top of the screen without colliding with any cars.

As the level increases:
- More cars begin to spawn
- Car speed increases
- The game becomes more challenging

This project is a great beginner-friendly introduction to object-oriented programming, game loops, and graphics using Python’s Turtle module.
